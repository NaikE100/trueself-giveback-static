# ✅ Correct Files to Upload for TrueSelf

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use the Right Files!

**DO NOT upload the root `index.html`** - that file is for "Tammy's Shades of Curls"!

## ✅ Correct File Location

All TrueSelf files are located in:
```
TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/
```

**NOT in the root directory!**

## Files to Upload

### From: `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/`

### To: `/domains/trueselfgiveback.com/public_html/`

### Root Files:
1. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/index.html` ← **This is the correct one!**
2. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/rules.html`
3. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/favicon.svg`
4. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/robots.txt`
5. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/sitemap.xml`

### Folders:
1. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/css/style.css` → `/public_html/css/`
2. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/js/app.js` → `/public_html/js/`
3. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/js/config.js` → `/public_html/js/`
4. ✅ `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/images/trueself-logo.png` → `/public_html/images/`

## How to Verify You Have the Right File

The correct `index.html` should have:
- Title: "TrueSelf | #NoFilterGiveBack - Authentic Selfie Competition"
- Contains: "Show Your True Self"
- Contains: "No filters. No edits. Just authentic you, for a cause."

The wrong `index.html` (root directory) has:
- Title: "Tammy's Shades of Curls - Premium Hair Products"
- Contains: "Discover Your Perfect Hair Style"

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Using files from `TrueSelf-GiveBack/TrueSelf-GiveBack/` folder
- [ ] NOT using root `index.html` (that's for Tammy's)
- [ ] Uploading `index.html` that says "TrueSelf" in the title
- [ ] All files from the correct directory
